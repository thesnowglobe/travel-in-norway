                The Aurlandsfjord is considered one of the most picturesque and dramatic fjords in the world.
                The fjord is located in the Fjordane district between Flam and the Beitelen Mountains and flows through
                the local authorities of Vik, Aurland, and Lærdal and near the villages of Flam, Aurlandsvangen,
                and Undredal.

              <p class="place__paragraph">
                This fjord covers 29 km and is part of the Sognefjord, the longest fjord in Norway.
                Aurlandsfjord is narrow and deep. It reaches an average depth of 962 meters and a maximum width of 2 km.
                Most of the fjord is surrounded by steep mountains that rise to a maximum height of 1800 meters.
                This is why most of the fjord is uninhabited except in the few small valleys around it.
